# About this project

This project is my project for Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) in CMU. More importantly, it's an attempt to improve students' 15-122 learning experience.

By employing various visualization and front-end technology, we make it possible to execute and visualize C0 Language on any device that supports modern browser. This project also allows instructors of 15-122 to embed runnable code exerciese in Learning Material System (LMS) like Canvas or Diderot thus creating a more interactive learning environment.
